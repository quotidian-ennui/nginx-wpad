`cautious-meme` or partying like it's 1999 for that is what it feels like.

Have you ever wondered what "automatically detect proxies" does. What it's like is stepping back in time when different things occupied us.

- Mars Polar Lander!
- Swatch time was a thing
- Dolly the sheep
- I toyed with buying a Dreamcast, but didn't. I did love Virtua Fighter though

`WinHttp-Autoproxy-Service` & `WININET Download` want some file called `wpad.dat`, and it's better that I give it to them rather than them finding it from somewhere else?
